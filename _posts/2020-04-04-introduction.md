![Jonas Schuett](/jonasschuett.jpg "Jonas Schuett")

I'm a Research Fellow at the [Centre for the Governance of AI (GovAI)](https://www.governance.ai/). I try to reduce catastrophic risks from AI by improving the governance of frontier AI developers. My research focuses on risk management, corporate governance, regulation, and auditing.

Before joining GovAI, I was seconded to the UK Cabinet Office to support their work on AI regulation, and interned at Google DeepMind’s Public Policy team. I also helped found the [Institute for Law and AI (LawAI](https://law-ai.org/) where I'm still a board member.

I'm currently wrapping up my PhD in law at Goethe University Frankfurt. I hold a law degree from Heidelberg University and have studied economics at the University of Zurich.


## Risk management

I do a lot of work on AI risk management. I try to figure out how frontier AI developers should manage catastrophic risks from AI.

I'm currently working on several projects that focus on various aspects of risk assessment: we're proposing a taxonomy of catastrophic risks from AI, developing a quantitative risk model, and reviewing risk thresholds from other safety critical industries. Besides that, I have recently published a paper in which we [review popular risk assessment techniques](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.08823) from other industries.

In the past, I have also worked on several projects related to risk governance. I have one paper on the [Three Lines of Defense model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.08364) and anohter one on [internal audit](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.17038). I also have one paper in which I conduct a [legal analysis of the main risk management provision in the proposed EU AI Act](https://doi.org/10.1017/err.2023.1).

## Corporate governance

My second focus is on corporate governance. Earlier this year, we published a [survey of AGI safety and governance experts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.07153). We also published a paper in which we make recommendations on [how to design an AI ethics board](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.07249). A while back, I also contributed to an [introductory paper on corporate governance](https://doi.org/10.3390/info12070275).


## Auditing

My third focus is on auditing. I just published a paper in which we propose an [evaluation-based coordination scheme](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.00374). I also contributed to a paper on [auditing large language models](https://doi.org/10.1007/s43681-023-00289-2) and [AI certification](https://doi.org/10.1109/TTS.2021.3077595).


## Regulation

Finally, I've done some work on AI regulation. On the theoretical side of things, I contributed to a paper on [frontier AI regulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.03718). I also have a paper on [defining the scope of AI regulations](https://doi.org/10.1080/17579961.2023.2184135) and, as mentioned above, a paper on [risk management in the AI Act](https://doi.org/10.1017/err.2023.1).

On the practical side of things, I was seconded to the UK Cabinet Office to support their work on AI regulation. I mainly gave input on the white paper [A pro-innovation approach to AI regulation](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/ai-regulation-a-pro-innovation-approach/white-paper).

### Personal

I live in Berlin, but come to Oxford every 1-2 months. I’m engaged to my high school sweetheart, and we have the best dog in the world. I’m a big fan of specialty coffee---I've been called a "coffee snob". I’m vegan to avoid unnecessary suffering of animals.
